In my free time I like to reverse engineer game network protocols.

## Projects

#### [QPang Essence Emulator](https://github.com/Deluze/qpang-essence-emulator):
A [QPang/MangaFigher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_Fighter) server emulator written in C++. This project was my first ever project and was made for educational purposes to learn about the x86 assembly language, C++, network protocols and reverse engineering. This server emulator has been used in Project Essence / QPang.io which had thousands of active players and handled hundreds of concurrent players.

#### *(WIP)* [StreamPlant](https://github.com/Deluze/stream-plant):
A tool for live streamers on Twitch to enhance their streams with a chatbot, a webserver for custom browser sources and more. Fully open-source and no commercial features. The tool will support user made plug-ins to add additional or extend features.
